# XpayFinance_LLM
A Large Language ML Model that summarizes the Financial health of a company using OpenAI APIs and Streamlit Rendering. This project demonstrates the utilization of a ChromaDB vectorstore within a Langchain pipeline to develop a GPT Investment Summarizer. The system allows for loading PDF documents and employing them in conjunction with a pre-trained language model, such as GPT, without requiring additional fine-tuning.
