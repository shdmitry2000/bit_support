              "'Compression Using a compression sleeve, elastic bandage wrap or brace on the affected ankle can prevent excessive swelling, protect the area from repeated injuries and provide support. Some inflammation is needed for healing, but too much can be harmful. Elevation The early treatment for an ankle sprain is the \"RICE\" method of treatment. This is focused on reducing swelling and reducing pain: Rest: The first 24 to 48 hours after the injury is considered a critical treatment period. Limit activities and use an assistive device, like a crutch, if you must walk. Health Library / Diseases & Conditions / Sprains Sprains Sprains are common injuries. They happen when ligaments around one of your joints are stretched or torn. Sport injuries and falls are the most common causes. I ce: Using ice as a sprain treatment can help reduce both swelling and pain, but too much ice can slow down the healing process, so use sparingly. C ompression: Wrap the injured area in an Ace bandage to help flush out fluid buildup. E levation: Propping up the injured area helps the body absorb fluid that has leaked into the tissue. To get back on your feet the safe way, try following the acronym R.I.C.E. to treat your sprained ankle: rest, ice, compress, and elevate. References British Red Cross. (n.d.).
